# 🐤 Hi I'm Seng. 🐤

I dropped out of engineering school in 2011, worked as a chef for six years then graduated from business school in 2021. 
Now I'm doing my military service as an interpertation officer whilst studying to become a data scientist. Join me, an absolute beginner, on my journey to becoming a data scientist from scratch. 

Currently based in Seoul 🇰🇷
